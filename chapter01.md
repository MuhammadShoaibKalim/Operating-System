What is an Operating System?
An operating system (OS) is a fundamental software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. It's essentially the backbone of a computer, ensuring that everything runs smoothly and efficiently.

Key Functions of an Operating System:
1. Resource Management:

 1.1 Processor Management: The OS schedules processes for execution by the CPU, ensuring that each process gets adequate time to run.
 1.2 Memory Management: It manages the computer’s memory, keeping track of each byte in a computer’s memory and managing the allocation and de-allocation of memory spaces as needed.
 1.3 Storage Management: The OS manages data storage options, including hard drives, SSDs, and other storage media, ensuring data is read and written efficiently.
 1.4 Device Management: The OS controls and manages hardware devices like printers, monitors, and keyboards, ensuring they operate correctly.

2. User Interface:

  2.1 Graphical User Interface (GUI): 
  Most modern operating systems offer a GUI, allowing users to interact with the system through graphical icons and visual indicators.
  2.2 Command-Line Interface (CLI): 
  Some operating systems also offer a CLI for more direct and scriptable interaction with the OS.

3. File Management:
   The OS manages files on various storage devices, organizing them into directories for easy navigation and access.
   It handles file permissions, ensuring that users can only access files they are authorized to use.

4. Security and Access Control:
   The OS protects system data and resources from unauthorized access and ensures that users and programs can only perform actions they are permitted to.
   It includes mechanisms for user authentication and authorization.

5. Task Management:
   The OS oversees the execution of tasks, enabling multitasking by running multiple processes simultaneously.
   It manages the prioritization of tasks, ensuring critical tasks receive more immediate attention from the CPU.
