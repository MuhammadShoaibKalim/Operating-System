# Chapter 28: What is Virtual Memory? | Page Fault in OS?

## 1. What is Virtual Memory?
- **Definition**: Virtual memory is a memory management technique that allows processes to use more memory than what is physically available by using disk space as an extension of RAM.
- **How it Works**: Explanation of how virtual memory works using demand paging and the role of the page table.

## 2. Page Fault in OS
- **Definition**: A page fault occurs when a process tries to access a page that is not currently in physical memory.
- **Handling Page Faults**: Steps the OS takes to handle a page fault, including loading the page from disk to memory and updating the page table.
- **Page Replacement**: Discussion of page replacement algorithms used when physical memory is full.

## 3. Examples and Illustrations
- **Page Fault Example**: Example showing how a page fault occurs and how it is handled by the OS.
- **Illustrative Diagrams**: Diagrams showing the virtual memory system and the page fault handling process.

## Conclusion
- Discuss how virtual memory allows for more efficient use of physical memory and enables larger processes to run on systems with limited RAM.
