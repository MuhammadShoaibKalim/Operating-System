# Chapter 29: Page Replacement Algorithm? | How to Implement LRU Algorithm?

## 1. Page Replacement Algorithms
- **Definition**: Page replacement algorithms determine which pages to swap out when physical memory is full and a new page needs to be loaded.
- **Common Algorithms**:
  - **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**: Replaces the oldest page in memory.
  - **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Replaces the page that has not been used for the longest time.
  - **Optimal Algorithm**: Replaces the page that will not be used for the longest time in the future (theoretical).
  - **Clock Algorithm**: An approximation of LRU using a circular list and a reference bit.

## 2. How to Implement LRU Algorithm?
- **Implementation Details**: Explanation of how to implement the LRU algorithm using data structures like stacks or linked lists.
- **Code Example**: Example code in C++ demonstrating the LRU page replacement algorithm.

## 3. Examples and Illustrations
- **Page Replacement Example**: Example showing how different page replacement algorithms work in a given scenario.
- **Illustrative Diagrams**: Diagrams showing the flow of page replacement algorithms.

## Conclusion
- Discuss the trade-offs between different page replacement algorithms and how they impact system performance.
