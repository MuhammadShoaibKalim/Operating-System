# Chapter 02: What are the Types of Operating Systems?

Operating systems come in various types, each designed to meet different needs and environments. Understanding these types helps in choosing the right OS for specific tasks and devices.

## 1. Batch Operating System

### Overview:
- Batch operating systems execute jobs in batches. Users prepare their jobs on offline devices like punch cards, which are then collected and processed sequentially by the OS.

### Characteristics:
- No direct interaction between the user and the computer during processing.
- Jobs are processed in the order of submission.

### Examples:
- Early IBM mainframes using systems like IBSYS and OS/360.

## 2. Time-Sharing Operating System

### Overview:
- Time-sharing OS allows multiple users to share computer resources simultaneously. The CPU time is divided among users, providing each with a time slice.

### Characteristics:
- Provides interactive computing.
- Reduces idle time by quickly switching between tasks.

### Examples:
- UNIX, Multics.

## 3. Distributed Operating System

### Overview:
- Distributed OS manages a group of independent computers and makes them appear to be a single computer. They share computational tasks and resources.

### Characteristics:
- Enhances performance and resource sharing.
- Provides reliability and fault tolerance.

### Examples:
- Amoeba, Plan 9, LOCUS.

## 4. Network Operating System

### Overview:
- Network OS runs on a server and provides networking features such as file sharing across multiple computers in a network. Each computer has its own OS with network capabilities.

### Characteristics:
- Centralized server controls.
- Facilitates network resource sharing.

### Examples:
- Novell NetWare, Windows Server.

## 5. Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)

### Overview:
- RTOS is designed to process data as it comes in, typically without buffer delays. They are used in environments where timing is critical.

### Characteristics:
- Offers high reliability and time predictability.
- Used in embedded systems and time-critical applications.

### Examples:
- VxWorks, FreeRTOS, RTLinux.

## 6. Embedded Operating System

### Overview:
- Embedded OS is designed to run on embedded systems. These are specialized systems designed for specific control functions within larger systems.

### Characteristics:
- Optimized for specific hardware.
- Usually, have limited resources.

### Examples:
- Embedded Linux, Windows Embedded, QNX.

## 7. Mobile Operating System

### Overview:
- Mobile OS is designed specifically for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets.

### Characteristics:
- Optimized for touch screen and mobile hardware.
- Supports mobile applications and connectivity features.

### Examples:
- Android, iOS, Windows Phone.

## 8. Desktop Operating System

### Overview:
- Desktop OS is designed for personal computers, providing a user-friendly interface and a wide range of functionalities for general use.

### Characteristics:
- Supports a variety of applications and peripherals.
- Provides a graphical user interface (GUI).

### Examples:
- Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora).

## 9. Server Operating System

### Overview:
- Server OS is designed to run on servers, providing features and capabilities required to serve multiple clients and handle heavy computational tasks.

### Characteristics:
- Optimized for network services, such as web servers, database servers, and file servers.
- Enhanced security and stability.

### Examples:
- Windows Server, Linux Server distributions (e.g., CentOS, Ubuntu Server), UNIX.

## 10. Mainframe Operating System

### Overview:
- Mainframe OS is designed for large-scale computers used primarily by large organizations for critical applications, bulk data processing, and large-scale transaction processing.

### Characteristics:
- Highly reliable and scalable.
- Capable of handling extensive I/O operations and numerous concurrent users.

### Examples:
- IBM z/OS, Unisys OS 2200, Linux on IBM Z.
