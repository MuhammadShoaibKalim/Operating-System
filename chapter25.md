# Chapter 25: How OS Manages Free Space?

## 1. Introduction to Free Space Management
- **Importance**: Managing free space is crucial for efficient memory and disk utilization in an operating system.

## 2. Techniques for Managing Free Space
- **Bitmaps**: Using a bitmap to track free and used blocks of memory or disk space.
- **Linked Lists**: Using linked lists to track free and allocated blocks, with each node representing a block of memory.
- **Free Space Management Algorithms**:
  - **First-Fit**: Allocating the first available block that is large enough.
  - **Best-Fit**: Allocating the smallest available block that fits the request.
  - **Worst-Fit**: Allocating the largest available block to reduce fragmentation.

## 3. Practical Considerations
- **Performance Trade-offs**: Discussion of how different free space management techniques impact system performance.
- **Fragmentation**: How different strategies can lead to or minimize fragmentation.

## Conclusion
- Summary of key methods used by operating systems to manage free space efficiently and ensure optimal memory usage.
