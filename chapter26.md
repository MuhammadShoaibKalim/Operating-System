# Chapter 26: What is Paging? | Non-contiguous Memory Allocation

## 1. What is Paging?
- **Definition**: Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory. It divides the process's memory into fixed-size pages and physical memory into frames.
- **How it Works**: Explanation of the page table, how logical addresses are translated to physical addresses, and the role of the MMU (Memory Management Unit).

## 2. Non-contiguous Memory Allocation
- **Definition**: Memory allocation technique where a processâ€™s memory can be allocated in non-contiguous blocks.
- **Advantages**: Reduces fragmentation and allows for more flexible memory management.
- **Implementation**: Explanation of how non-contiguous memory allocation is implemented using paging.

## 3. Examples and Illustrations
- **Paging Example**: Example showing how a logical address is mapped to a physical address using paging.
- **Illustrative Diagrams**: Diagrams showing the structure of a page table and the translation process.

## Conclusion
- Discuss how paging solves the problems of fragmentation and the limitations of contiguous memory allocation.
