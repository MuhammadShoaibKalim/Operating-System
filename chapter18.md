# Chapter 18: Producer-Consumer Problem and Its Solution

## 1. What is the Producer-Consumer Problem?
- **Definition**: A classic synchronization problem where one or more producers generate data and one or more consumers process the data.
- **Challenges**: Ensuring that the producer doesn’t overflow the buffer and the consumer doesn’t underflow it.

## 2. Solutions to Producer-Consumer Problem
- **Using Semaphores**: Implementing a solution using two semaphores for synchronization between producer and consumer.
- **Using Mutexes and Condition Variables**: An alternative solution using mutexes and condition variables.
- **Example Code**: Example implementations in C++ for both semaphore and condition variable solutions.

## Conclusion
- Highlight the importance of synchronization in solving real-world problems where multiple threads interact.
