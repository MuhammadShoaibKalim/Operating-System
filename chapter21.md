# Chapter 21: What is Deadlock? | Necessary Conditions | Handling Method | Part-1

## 1. What is Deadlock?
- **Definition**: A deadlock is a state in which a set of processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by another process.
- **Examples**: Real-world analogies and examples of deadlock scenarios.

## 2. Necessary Conditions for Deadlock
- **Mutual Exclusion**: Only one process can use a resource at a time.
- **Hold and Wait**: A process holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources held by other processes.
- **No Preemption**: Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a process.
- **Circular Wait**: A set of processes are waiting in a circular chain for resources.

## 3. Handling Deadlock
- **Prevention**: Strategies to prevent any of the necessary conditions for deadlock.
- **Avoidance**: Using algorithms like Banker's algorithm to avoid entering unsafe states.
- **Detection and Recovery**: Techniques to detect deadlock and recover from it by preempting resources or terminating processes.

## Conclusion
- The importance of understanding and handling deadlocks to ensure smooth operation of systems.
