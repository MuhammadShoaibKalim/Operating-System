# Chapter 15: What is Concurrency? | Multi-threading in C++

## 1. What is Concurrency?
- **Definition**: Concurrency is the ability of a system to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. It is a core concept in parallel computing and modern multi-core processors.
- **Concurrency vs Parallelism**: Concurrency is about dealing with multiple tasks at the same time, while parallelism is about executing multiple tasks simultaneously.
- **Examples in OS**: Process management, I/O operations, and thread execution.

## 2. Multi-threading in C++
- **Introduction**: Multi-threading is a feature of C++ that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program to maximize the utilization of CPU.
- **Creating Threads**: Explanation of `std::thread` and how to create a new thread.
- **Thread Synchronization**: Using mutexes, locks, and condition variables to manage thread interaction and avoid race conditions.
- **Example Code**: Simple code examples demonstrating multi-threading in C++.

## Conclusion
- Summary of how concurrency and multi-threading enhance the performance of applications, especially in multi-core systems.
