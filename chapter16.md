# Chapter 16: Critical Section Problem? | Race Condition Problem

## 1. What is the Critical Section Problem?
- **Definition**: A critical section is a part of a program where shared resources are accessed.
- **Challenges**: The main challenge is to prevent multiple threads from entering the critical section simultaneously, leading to data corruption.
- **Solutions**: Mutexes, semaphores, and locks to protect critical sections.

## 2. Race Condition Problem
- **Definition**: A race condition occurs when the outcome of a program depends on the sequence or timing of uncontrollable events like thread scheduling.
- **Examples**: Example scenarios in multi-threaded programs where race conditions can occur.
- **Prevention**: Techniques to prevent race conditions using thread synchronization mechanisms.

## Conclusion
- Emphasize the importance of managing access to shared resources to ensure the correct operation of multi-threaded programs.
