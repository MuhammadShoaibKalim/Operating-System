# Chapter 27: What is Segmentation? | Non-contiguous Memory Allocation

## 1. What is Segmentation?
- **Definition**: Segmentation is a memory management scheme that divides the process's memory into different segments based on the logical divisions such as code, data, and stack.
- **Segment Table**: Explanation of how segment tables are used to map logical addresses to physical addresses.
- **Logical vs Physical Addresses**: Discussion on how segmentation separates the logical view of memory from the physical memory.

## 2. Non-contiguous Memory Allocation
- **Segmentation in Non-contiguous Allocation**: How segmentation allows non-contiguous allocation of memory blocks.
- **Advantages**: Provides a way to organize memory that matches the logical structure of the program.

## 3. Examples and Illustrations
- **Segmentation Example**: Example showing how a logical address is mapped to a physical address using segmentation.
- **Illustrative Diagrams**: Diagrams showing the structure of a segment table and the translation process.

## Conclusion
- Discuss how segmentation provides a more logical and flexible approach to memory management compared to paging.
