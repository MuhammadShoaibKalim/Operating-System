# Chapter 22: Deadlock Avoidance | Deadlock Detection and Recovery | Part-2

## 1. Deadlock Avoidance
- **Definition**: Techniques to ensure that the system never enters a deadlock state.
- **Banker's Algorithm**: Detailed explanation of the Banker's algorithm, including its implementation and use cases.

## 2. Deadlock Detection
- **Detection Algorithms**: Techniques to detect deadlocks, such as resource allocation graphs.
- **Detection in Distributed Systems**: Challenges and methods for detecting deadlocks in distributed systems.

## 3. Deadlock Recovery
- **Recovery Techniques**: Methods to recover from deadlock, such as process termination or resource preemption.
- **Choosing Victims**: Criteria for choosing which process to terminate or preempt in order to break the deadlock.

## Conclusion
- Discuss how deadlock avoidance, detection, and recovery strategies contribute to robust system design.
