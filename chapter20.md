# Chapter 19: The Reader-Writer Problem and Its Solution

## 1. What is the Reader-Writer Problem?
- **Definition**: A synchronization problem where multiple threads either read or write to a shared resource.
- **Challenges**: Ensuring that multiple readers can read simultaneously, but only one writer can write at a time.

## 2. Solutions to Reader-Writer Problem
- **Priority Solutions**: Solutions where either readers or writers are given priority.
- **Using Semaphores**: Implementing reader-writer locks using semaphores to ensure mutual exclusion and synchronization.
- **Example Code**: Example implementation in C++ demonstrating the reader-writer solution.

## Conclusion
- Discuss how different strategies for prioritizing readers or writers affect system performance and resource management.
