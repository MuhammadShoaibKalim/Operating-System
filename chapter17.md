# Chapter 17: Conditional Variables and Semaphores to Synchronize Threads

## 1. Conditional Variables
- **Definition**: A condition variable is a synchronization primitive that allows threads to wait until a particular condition is true.
- **Usage**: Used with mutexes to block a thread until notified by another thread that a condition has been met.
- **Example**: Code snippets demonstrating how to use condition variables in C++.

## 2. Semaphores
- **Definition**: Semaphores are signaling mechanisms to control access to a common resource by multiple threads.
- **Types**: Binary semaphore (mutex) and counting semaphore.
- **Usage**: Managing access to limited resources, implementing critical sections.
- **Example**: Code demonstrating the implementation of semaphores.

## Conclusion
- Importance of synchronization mechanisms in avoiding race conditions and ensuring proper thread coordination.
