# Chapter 10: What are the Different States of a Process?

In an operating system, a process goes through several distinct states during its lifecycle. These states represent the status of a process as it moves through different phases of execution, from creation to termination. Understanding these states is essential for grasping how an OS manages multiple processes simultaneously.

## Process States

### 1. **New**

- **Description**: The process is in the initial stage of its lifecycle. It has been created but has not yet been admitted to the pool of executable processes.
- **Activities**:
  - The operating system has allocated a Process Control Block (PCB) for the process.
  - Memory is allocated for the process's code, data, and stack segments.
- **Transition**: The process moves from the "New" state to the "Ready" state once it is prepared to execute.

### 2. **Ready**

- **Description**: The process is loaded into memory and ready to execute, but it is waiting for CPU time to be allocated.
- **Activities**:
  - The process is queued in the ready queue, waiting for the CPU scheduler to select it for execution.
  - It has all necessary resources except for the CPU.
- **Transition**: The process moves from "Ready" to "Running" when the CPU becomes available and the scheduler assigns CPU time to the process.

### 3. **Running**

- **Description**: The process is currently being executed by the CPU. Only one process can be in this state on a single-core processor at any given time (unless multi-threading is supported).
- **Activities**:
  - The CPU executes the instructions of the process.
  - The process uses CPU registers, stack, and memory during execution.
- **Transition**:
  - **To Waiting**: If the process needs to wait for an I/O operation or another event.
  - **To Ready**: If the process is preempted by the scheduler to allow another process to run (in preemptive multitasking systems).
  - **To Terminated**: If the process completes its execution.

### 4. **Waiting (Blocked)**

- **Description**: The process cannot continue execution until some external event occurs, such as the completion of an I/O operation or the availability of a resource.
- **Activities**:
  - The process waits in a queue for the specific event or condition.
  - It does not consume CPU time while waiting.
- **Transition**: The process moves from "Waiting" back to "Ready" once the event it was waiting for occurs, making it eligible to run again.

### 5. **Terminated (Exit)**

- **Description**: The process has finished its execution, either by completing normally or due to an error or interruption.
- **Activities**:
  - The operating system deallocates resources associated with the process, such as memory and file handles.
  - The process enters a "zombie" state temporarily if its exit status needs to be collected by its parent process.
- **Transition**: The process is removed from the process table and its PCB is destroyed after cleanup.

### 6. **Suspended (Swapped)**

- **Description**: The process is temporarily removed from main memory and placed in secondary storage (such as a swap file or swap partition) to free up memory for other processes.
- **Activities**:
  - The process is inactive while it is swapped out of memory.
  - It is not available for execution until it is brought back into memory.
- **Transition**:
  - **To Ready**: When the process is swapped back into main memory, it returns to the "Ready" state, awaiting CPU time.
  - **To Terminated**: If the process is terminated while in the suspended state.

### 7. **Zombie**

- **Description**: The process has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table, awaiting its parent process to read its exit status.
- **Activities**:
  - The process's resources (except for the PCB and exit status) have been released.
  - The process remains in this state until its parent process retrieves its termination status using a system call like `wait()`.
- **Transition**: The process is fully removed from the system once the parent process retrieves the exit status, completing the cleanup process.

## Process State Transitions

The transitions between these states are managed by the operating system based on various conditions such as I/O completion, CPU scheduling, and system calls. These transitions are crucial for multitasking and efficient CPU utilization.

- **New → Ready**: Process creation is complete.
- **Ready → Running**: Process is scheduled for execution.
- **Running → Waiting**: Process waits for I/O or another event.
- **Running → Ready**: Process is preempted by another process.
- **Running → Terminated**: Process execution is complete.
- **Waiting → Ready**: Process's waiting condition is fulfilled.
- **Ready/Running → Suspended**: Process is swapped out of memory.
- **Suspended → Ready**: Process is swapped back into memory.

## Conclusion

Understanding the different states of a process and their transitions is key to grasping how an operating system manages resources, multitasks, and ensures smooth operation of multiple applications. The process states help the OS organize and control the flow of execution, allowing it to efficiently handle complex computational tasks.
