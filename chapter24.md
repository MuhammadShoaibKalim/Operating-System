# Chapter 24: Memory Management System | Contiguous Memory Allocation

## 1. Introduction to Memory Management
- **Definition**: Memory management is the process of controlling and coordinating computer memory, assigning portions to processes, and managing the swapping of memory to and from the disk.

## 2. Contiguous Memory Allocation
- **Definition**: In contiguous memory allocation, each process is allocated a single contiguous block of memory.
- **Memory Allocation Techniques**: 
  - **Fixed Partitioning**: Dividing memory into fixed-size partitions.
  - **Dynamic Partitioning**: Allocating memory dynamically based on process size.
- **Fragmentation**: 
  - **External Fragmentation**: Wasted space outside of allocated regions.
  - **Internal Fragmentation**: Wasted space within allocated regions.
- **Compaction**: Technique to overcome external fragmentation by rearranging memory.

## 3. Examples and Illustrations
- **Illustrative Diagrams**: Visual diagrams showing how contiguous memory allocation works and how fragmentation occurs.

## Conclusion
- Discuss the importance of memory management techniques in optimizing system performance and resource utilization.
